# ReactLoginPage
Hi! Thanks for checking out my react login page, this is how you can get it to run locally:

1. CD into the backend directory, and run pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Then run python main.py, follow the local host link and check that the site displays "Wassup yall"

3. CD into the backend, Before setting up React and Material-UI, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/.

4. Install Material-UI: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

5. Run npm start
